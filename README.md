## About Me

My journey into development started with curiosity about how websites work.  
Today, I build full stack applications using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL.

I enjoy creating complete systems — writing backend logic, designing databases, and building user-friendly frontends.  
I believe the best way to learn is by building real projects and solving real problems.
